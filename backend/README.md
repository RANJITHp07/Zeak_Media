# SocialMedia-backend
Project Name: Social Media Website - Backend

Description:
This project is the backend part of a social media website, responsible for handling user authentication, data storage, and serving API endpoints to support the frontend functionality. It provides a scalable and secure backend infrastructure for the social media platform.

Key Features:
- User Authentication: Implement secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- API Endpoints: Develop RESTful APIs to support frontend functionality such as user profiles, posts, likes, and friend requests.
- Database Management: Design and manage the database schema for storing user information, posts, and other relevant data.
- File Storage: Implement file storage to handle user profile pictures and uploaded media files.
- Security: Implement measures to ensure data privacy, protect against common security vulnerabilities, and prevent unauthorized access.
- Performance and Scalability: Optimize backend code and database queries for efficient data retrieval and handle increased traffic as the user base grows.

Technologies Used:
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for building scalable and efficient backend applications.
- Express.js: Web application framework for handling routing, middleware, and API development.
- MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user information, posts, and other data.
- File Storage Solution: Utilize a cloud storage service (such as AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage) for handling file uploads.
- Security Measures: Implement best practices for data encryption, input validation, and protecting against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS attacks).
